smart devices are devices that have the ability to connect to collect data, process it and connect to the internet without the need of a human interception. 
the protocols that are used by the iot devices for communication are categorised into two ie the protocols used in data link communication (networking) and the protocol used for application or management and are as below .  (data platforms are the platforms that are used for collecting and storing data )
- for the point of data link communication, iot devices use technologies like Bluetooth for very short range often used for wearable eg smart watches, health diagnosing tools, headsets etc, wifi for medium range and large data sharing, real time monitoring used in camera monitoring, radars, voip etc. we have zigbee this one is also meant for low data, low range and low energy consumption and is a bit out dated and was replaced by ble. we have LoRaWAN. this one is made for low energy, small data sharing but to cover the longest range measured in miles or kilometres. we as well have the cellular networks as well which can also be used in the deployment of iot devices in ike smart city implementations 
- the other protocols deal in application and user management.
