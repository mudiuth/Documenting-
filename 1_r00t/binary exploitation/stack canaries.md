a stack canary is a secret value that is between the buffer and the return address. this value changes every time the program runs.. it is used as a counter measure to control buffer overflow. this value is checked before the function returns (the return command) if this value is changed, this means the return address is also overwritten thus automatically stopping the program. 
`buffer -> canary -> return address`

Checking the value every time the program runs comes with some resource penalties thus the option of removing the stack canaries at compile time. most compiles compile their program with the canary but there is the ability to remove the stack canaries at compile time and with gcc compilers, it can be done by using `fno-stack-protector` option. some compilers have the option to chose what functions u would want to compile without the canaries.
