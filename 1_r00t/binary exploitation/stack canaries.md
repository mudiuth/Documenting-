a stack canary is a secret value that is between the buffer and the return address. this value changes every time the program runs.. it is used as a counter measure to control buffer overflow. this value is checked before the function returns (the return command) if this value is changed, this means the return address is also overwritten thus automatically stopping the program. 
`buffer -> canary -> return address`

Checking the value every time the program runs comes with some resource penalties thus the option of removing the stack canaries at compile time. most compiles compile their program with the canary but there is the ability to remove the stack canaries at compile time and with gcc compilers, it can be done by using `fno-stack-protector` option. some compilers have the option to chose what functions u would want to compile without the canaries. 

**bypassing canaries**
stack canaries are not impossible to bypass just like any other firewall. one of the ways we can achieve this is by including the value of the canary in the payload we input when making a stack overflow. remember the canary value will always change whenever the program runs so this means to have a glimpse of the canary value, we need to  first leak it on runtime of the program. this can be achieved by exploiting memory leaking vulnerabilities in the program so that it can give us the  canary value.

**Brute forcing the canary value**
this is another way to bypass the stack canary security parameter.  this can be achieved by leveraging the fork program that is used in the POSIX systems. the POSIX is a set of standard that sets protocols that are followed by different systems to prove compatibility. the fork function will copy and clone the call function and take the canary as well  with it. so this can be used to bruteforce and get the vakue f the canary.
other ways include arbitrary writing, replacing the canary, bypassing exception handling, 

**NX/DEP/WâŠ•X**
these are parameters that will limit the execution of the payloads on the operation system. NX represents no execute on linux and unix operating systems. this follows the rule that no memory section can be marked writable or executable at the same time. when writing a shell code, we send the data to different memory sections but this can be limited by the presence of the NX on the memory sections that we would want to write to. so if u send the write instructions, the CPU will throw them
